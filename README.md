# KNN with CSGO data

An implementation of the K-nearest neighbours algorithm using python on some CSGO game data.

The data consists of stats of each round like score, kills, deaths, assists, etc.

If you're interested in using the same dataset, you can find it at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

## Note:

-   Since the nodebook size will get pretty big, I have split it into two files. One for data analysis and plots and the other for KNN.

-   The analysis file only has some EDA and plots, and it's file size if big as the data is big.
